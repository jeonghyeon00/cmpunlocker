# cmpunlocker

Unlock tool for the NVIDIA CMP 170HX (GA100) mining card. Restores full SM compute throughput and unlocked HBM2e memory geometry that are restricted in firmware/OTP configuration.

## Proof of Concept

Below are memory and performance results after applying the unlock:

## Requirements

- Linux (x86-64)
- Root access
- NVIDIA CMP 170HX
- **nvidia-open 610.43.0x already installed** (libs + firmware)
- Kernel headers matching the running kernel (`linux-headers-$(uname -r)` / `kernel-devel`)
- Secure Boot disabled (patched modules are unsigned)
- Network access on first install (downloads matching stock `open-gpu-kernel-modules` sources)
- Python 3 (used at build time to select 8GB/10GB geometry)

## Install

To install cmpunlocker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

To force a certain memory profile, use the `--profile` option:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --profile=8gb    # 8GB card → 64GB unlock
sudo ./install.sh --profile=10gb   # 10GB card → 40GB unlock
```

Then perform a cold reboot (full power off, then boot).

### HBM Memory Clock

`--mclk-ndiv=N` sets the FBPA PLL multiplier; the resulting clock is `N × 27` MHz. Any VBIOS works, on both `0x20C2` (8GB) and `0x2082` (10GB) — the driver reads the stock NDIV out of the PLL and rewrites only that field, leaving MDIV/PDIV as the VBIOS programmed them.

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --mclk-ndiv=70   # → 1890 MHz
```

| NDIV | Frequency | Notes                           |
|------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 45   | 1215 MHz  | Stock 10gb                      |
| 60   | 1620 MHz  | Works on ~60% of 10gb cards     |
| 54   | 1458 MHz  | Stock 8gb 250w vbios            |
| 64   | 1728 MHz  | Stock 8gb 300w vbios            |
| 70   | 1890 MHz  | Works on ~60% of 8gb cards      |
| 73   | 1971 MHz  | Usually only on lucky 8gb cards |

Values below stock downclock the card, which is the way to stabilise a card that fails at stock.

Without the flag, patches `0009` and `0010` are not applied at all. The multiplier is compiled into the modules, so changing it means re-running `install.sh`. In a mixed 8GB+10GB system the same multiplier lands on every card.

If a value turns out to be unstable - reinstall without `--mclk-ndiv` (or run `./remove.sh`) from a working state.

#### Using 170tune

For live HBM tuning with [170tune](https://github.com/cachenetics/170tune), install cmpunlocker **without** `--mclk-ndiv`. The FBPA PLL privilege window is still opened, while the driver leaves the stock NDIV untouched. A driver built with `--mclk-ndiv` bakes in a non-stock clock, and 170tune intentionally refuses to tune on top of it.

See [the per-card 170tune HBM validation record](docs/170TUNE_HBM_VALIDATION.md) for a conservative
deployment example, qualification results, and recovery commands.

## Uninstall

To uninstall cmpunlocker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh --yes
```

Then perform a cold reboot (full power off, then boot).
